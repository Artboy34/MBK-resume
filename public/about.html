<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Martin Bentley Krebs, owner and creative director of <a href="https://www.windymeadow.net">Windy Meadow Consulting</a>, my freelance graphic design business. I have a number of freelance clients, mostly nonprofits, for whom I provide effective and affordable graphic design services. These projects include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Logo Design/Corporate Identity Programs</li>
  <li>Publication and Collateral Design</li>
  <li>Web Development</li>
  <li>Event Planning Services</li>
</ul> 
<p>I work full-time for <a href="https://www.able-services.org">Able-Services, Inc.</a>, a non-profit agency that provides licensed day program services to adults with intellectual disabilities, serving as a Program Specialist. After more than 35 years in the advertising and marketing field, I made a career switch to Human Services, specifically working with the adult special needs population, and I haven't looked back since. Providing services aimed at developing skills for living as independently as possible gives great clarity, purpose, and reason to each day.If you have the opportunity to meet, work with, or befriend anyone in this population, do so at the earliest possible opportunity — you will never regret it!</>
<p>I have been happily married for 41 years to a woman who is my best friend, and we have been blessed with three sons and two beautiful granddaughters. Our lives are filled with an abundance of creativity, music, art, laughter, and love that permeate every facet of our being. I am preparing to retire from full-time employment within the next year, so I'm looking forward to reconnecting with all of those artistic and creative endeavors that I've been putting on hold during my career[s]. They are about to be unleashed with passion and vigor! Stay tuned for more details as they happen...</p>
